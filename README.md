This project contains a scraper (stocks_info_scraper.ipynb) to get quarter financial reports for the last years. Gathered information contains Income statements, Balance sheets, Cashflow statements and Ratios. Also it retrieves a list of stocks tickers evaluated by market capitalization and their historical daily prices for a predefined range of time.
Based on this information, we build a ML model and try to predict (stocks_price_predictor.ipynb) the maximum price a stock could hit during a quarter period based on it's latest financial report. If succeded - the model could be used as a stock screener to find the most promising stocks prices growth for the upcoming period and decide the level of the take profit order depending on the maximum price predicted by the model.
